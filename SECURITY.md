# Security Policy

At ZITADEL we are extremely grateful for security aware people that disclose vulnerabilities to us and the open source community. All reports will be investigated by our team.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the following version of passwap:

| Version  | Supported          | Branch      | Details   |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| 0.x.x    | :white_check_mark: |             | supported |

## Reporting a vulnerability

To file a incident, please disclose by email to security@zitadel.com with the security details.

At the moment GPG encryption is no yet supported, however you may sign your message at will.

### When should I report a vulnerability

* You think you discovered a ...
  * ... potential security vulnerability in passwap
  * ... vulnerability in another project that passwap bases on
* For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there

### When should I NOT report a vulnerability

* You need help applying security related updates
* Your issue is not security related

## Security Vulnerability Response

TBD

## Public Disclosure

All accepted and mitigated vulnerabilities will be published on the [Github Security Page](https://github.com/zitadel/passwap/security/advisories)

### Timing

We think it is crucial to publish advisories `ASAP` as mitigations are ready. But due to the unknown nature of the disclosures the time frame can range from 7 to 90 days.
